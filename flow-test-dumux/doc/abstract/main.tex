            simulations in DuMux, version 3 introduces a more consistent
            abstraction of finite volume schemes. Finally, the new framework
            for multi-domain simulations is described, and three numerical
            examples demonstrate its flexibility.},

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
	The objective is to simulate water infiltration phenomena based on
	the Richards model~\cite{richards_capillary_1931}, in agricultural
	soils using specific parameters such as soil type, density,
	porosity, matric potential, and moisture holding capacity, among
	others.
	The simulation was performed using
	DuMu\textsuperscript{x}~\cite{Kochetal2020Dumux}, a C++ framework
	for porous media applications.
	Nowadays, these matters are crucial for agriculture due to the
	concern for efficient use and saving of water~\cite{colombia_2021},
	since large quantities of water are wasted annually for crops, and
	it is necessary to contrast the results of the simulations with the
	quantities currently used with traditional irrigation methods.
