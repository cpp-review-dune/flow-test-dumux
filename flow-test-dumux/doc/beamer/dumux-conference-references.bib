  abstract = {This paper presents the basic concepts and the module structure of
              the Distributed and Unified Numerics Environment and reflects on
              recent developments and general changes that happened since the
              release of the first Dune version in 2007 and the main papers
              describing that state Bastian etal. (2008a, 2008b). This discussion
              is accompanied with a description of various advanced features,
              such as coupling of domains and cut cells, grid modifications such
              as adaptation and moving domains, high order discretizations and
              node level performance, non-smooth multigrid methods, and
              multiscale methods. A brief discussion on current and future
              development directions of the framework concludes the paper.},
